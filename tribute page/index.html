    <p id="intro">Khalil Gibran was a writer, painter and philosopher whose thoughts created and still maintains a profound impact
        on the world. Although he passed away more than 80 years ago, his books are still read by people around the globe,his
        poetry quoted at weddings and ceremonies, and thousands of people visit his burial site with heads lowered out
        of respect and love. </p>
    <main>
    <h2>The Beginning</h2>
    <p>Khalil Gibran was born in the year 1883 to a Lebanese Christian family who lived in Bsharri, Lebanon. He
        received no formal schooling during his younger years due to his parents' poverty, but he learnt the Arabic and Syriac
        languages, as well as the Bible, from the tutelage of visiting priests.
        While Gibran was still a child, his father was sent away to jail for tax evasion and fraud. The family's
        property was then confiscated, and they were left homeless. Gibran's uncle had already emigrated to the US, so with a
        hope for better fortune his mother decided to follow suit. They moved to Boston which hosted the second largest
        Lebanese community in the US. </p>

    <p>As an adolescent Gibran's unique talent drew the attention of his teachers and he was introduced to the
        well-known artist and publisher, Fred Holland Day, who fully supported Gibran on his path of creative expression. Three
        years after he started school, he published a volume of drawings which were used for book covers in 1898.</p>
    <h2>His Art</h2>
    <p>In 1904, Gibran hosted his first art exhibition. Four years later, he went to Paris with the sculptor and friend
        Auguste Rodin, and stayed there for two years.
        <br> In an article published on The Metropolitan Museum of Art's
         <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/487711"target="_blank">website</a>,
        his art was described as "mystical, with lyrical movements of ethereal figures or portraits that enter
        landscapelike apparitions. It often explores the symbols and elements of nature, time, and space while pushing the
        boundaries between physicality and spirituality." </p>

    <h2>His Books</h2>
    <p>All of Gibran's earlier books were written in his home language, Arabic, but the books published after 1918 were
        mostly in English. <br> Gibran published 8 books in Arabic, most of them available with an english translation.</p><br>

         was adapted into an animated film and produced by Salma Hayek in 2014.</h4></span>
    <h2> His Passing</h2>
    <p> During the publication of The Prophet, Gibran began to drink seriously. He spent the last few years of his life
        isolated in his apartment, with nothing but alcohol and his writing to keep him company. The severe alcoholism
        negatively impacted his liver, and this, along with tuberculosis, carried him to his death at 48 years old. <br>
        He died in a hospital bed within the walls of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent%27s_Catholic_Medical_Center"target="_blank">St Vincent's Catholic Medical Center. </a> 
        On his gravestone in Lebanon, the place in which he was both born and buried, there is his quote: </p>
    <h4>"A word I want to see written on my grave: I am alive like you, and I am standing beside you. Close your eyes
        and
        look around, you will see me in front of you." </h4>

    <h3>On Death </h3>
    <h4> You would know the secret of death. <br>
        But how shall you find it unless you seek it in the heart of life?<br>
        The owl whose night-bound eyes are blind unto the day cannot unveil the mystery of light.<br>
        If you would indeed behold the spirit of death, open your heart wide unto the body of life.<br>
        For life and death are one, even as the river and the sea are one.<br>
        In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond; <br>
        And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring.<br>
        Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.<br>
        Your fear of death is but the trembling of the shepherd when he stands before the king whose hand is to be laid
        upon him in honour.<br>
        Is the shepherd not joyful beneath his trembling, that he shall wear the mark of the king?<br>
        Yet is he not more mindful of his trembling? <br>
        For what is it to die but to stand naked in the wind and to melt into the sun? <br>
        And what is it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that it may rise and expand
        and seek God unencumbered? <br>
        Only when you drink from the river of silence shall you indeed sing. <br>
        And when you have reached the mountain top, then you shall begin to climb. <br>
        And when the earth shall claim your limbs, then shall you truly dance. <br>
